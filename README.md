## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [AngularJS](https://angular.io/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Preprocessor


### What I learned

I learnt how to work with the Date object much more than how i did previously, along with the usage of a lot of css nuances


### Useful resources

- [Angular Documentation](https://angular.io/docs) - Simple and accurate documentation from Angular community was very helpful when trying to figure out how to do many of the things i was trying for the first time.
